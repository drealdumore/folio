# Samuel Isah (@drealdumore)

Full-Stack Web and Mobile Developer creating innovative applications with React, Next.js, React Native, and TypeScript. I specialize in modern web development, mobile apps, and user-centric design solutions.

## About Me
I'm Samuel Isah, a developer who builds both web and mobile applications. I enjoy creating clean, functional solutions that solve real problems. My approach focuses on modern technologies, performance, and user experience. I'm particularly passionate about React ecosystem, TypeScript, and building apps that people actually want to use.

## My Development Style & Preferences
- **Clean, minimal code** - I prefer readable, maintainable code over clever tricks
- **TypeScript everywhere** - Strong typing helps catch issues early and improves developer experience  
- **Mobile-first thinking** - I build with mobile users in mind, then enhance for desktop
- **Performance matters** - Fast loading, smooth animations, optimized images
- **User-centric design** - Features should solve real problems, not just look cool
- **Offline-first when possible** - Apps should work even with poor connectivity

## My Tech Stack Preferences
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
**Mobile:** React Native, Expo, TypeScript
**Backend:** Node.js, API routes, serverless functions
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design systems, dark themes
**Tools:** Vercel for deployment, Resend for emails, Sharp for images

## This Portfolio Project
This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my work and experience. It's built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The site demonstrates my development skills while serving as a platform to share my projects and connect with potential collaborators.

## My Project Types & Interests
**Web Applications:** I build full-stack web apps with modern frameworks, focusing on performance and user experience
**Mobile Apps:** React Native apps that solve real problems - like Echo (location-based reminders) and GPZ (GPA tracking)
**Client Work:** Professional websites for businesses, from cleaning services to tech agencies
**Developer Tools:** Utilities and tools that make development easier and more efficient
**UI/UX Focus:** I care deeply about design, animations, and creating delightful user experiences

## How I Work
- **Problem-first approach** - I start with the user problem, then choose the right tech
- **Iterative development** - Build, test, refine, repeat
- **Documentation matters** - Code should be self-documenting, but context helps
- **Performance optimization** - Fast is better than fancy
- **Accessibility conscious** - Apps should work for everyone
- **SEO and discoverability** - If you build it well, people should find it

## My Current Projects
- **Echo:** Location-based reminder app (React Native)
- **GPZ:** GPA tracker for students (React Native) 
- **Portfolio:** This website showcasing my work
- **Client projects:** Various business websites and applications
- **Developer tools:** Small utilities and productivity apps

## Communication Style
I prefer direct, practical communication. When working on code:
- Show me the specific issue or goal
- I like seeing code examples and concrete suggestions
- Performance and user experience are always priorities
- I'm open to new approaches if they solve problems better
- Keep explanations concise but thorough when needed

## What I'm Learning
Currently exploring: AI integration in apps, advanced React Native patterns, performance optimization techniques, and better ways to handle state management in complex applications.
