# Samuel Isah (@drealdumore)

Full-Stack Web and Mobile Developer creating innovative applications with React, Next.js, React Native, and TypeScript. I specialize in modern web development, mobile apps, and user-centric design solutions.

## About Me
I'm Samuel Isah, a developer who builds both web and mobile applications. I enjoy creating clean, functional solutions that solve real problems. My approach focuses on modern technologies, performance, and user experience. I'm particularly passionate about React ecosystem, TypeScript, and building apps that people actually want to use.

## My Development Style & Preferences
- **Clean, minimal code** - I prefer readable, maintainable code over clever tricks
- **TypeScript everywhere** - Strong typing helps catch issues early and improves developer experience  
- **Mobile-first thinking** - I build with mobile users in mind, then enhance for desktop
- **Performance matters** - Fast loading, smooth animations, optimized images
- **User-centric design** - Features should solve real problems, not just look cool
- **Offline-first when possible** - Apps should work even with poor connectivity

## My Tech Stack Preferences
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
**Mobile:** React Native, Expo, TypeScript
**Backend:** Node.js, API routes, serverless functions
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design systems, dark themes
**Tools:** Vercel for deployment, Resend for emails, Sharp for images

## This Portfolio Project
This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my work and experience. It's built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The site demonstrates my development skills while serving as a platform to share my projects and connect with potential collaborators.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

**Framework & Core:**
- Next.js 14 with App Router (TypeScript)

- Server-side rendering and static generation

**Styling & Design:**
- Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- Custom fonts: Geist, Satoshi, AWS Diatype, AWS Diatype Mono
- Dark theme with custom color palette
- Framer Motion for animations
- Custom keyframes: reveal, tilt, blob animations

**Performance & Optimization:**
- Sharp for image optimization
- Vercel Analytics integration
- SEO optimized with meta tags, sitemap, robots.txt
- Open Graph and Twitter Card support
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for search engines

**Communication:**
- Resend API for email functionality
- React Email for email templates
- Contact form with server-side validation

## Development Patterns

**Component Structure:**
- TypeScript interfaces for all props and data
- Consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components)
- Separation of concerns (data, UI, logic)

**Data Management:**
- Static data in `/content` files with TypeScript types
- Structured project data with consistent interfaces
- SEO-friendly metadata management

**Styling Approach:**
- Utility-first CSS with Tailwind
- Custom CSS variables for theming
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Custom animations with Tailwind keyframes

**Performance Considerations:**
- Image optimization with Sharp
- Font optimization with local fonts and display: swap
- Code splitting with Next.js App Router
- Static generation where possible

## Key Features

**Project Showcase:**
- Multiple project types: web apps, mobile apps, client work
- Detailed project pages with galleries and case studies
- Technology tags and project categorization
- External links and GitHub integration

**Contact System:**
- Server-side contact form processing
- Email integration with Resend API
- Form validation and error handling
- Professional email templates

**SEO & Performance:**
- Complete meta tag implementation
- Open Graph and Twitter Card support
- Structured data for search engines
- Sitemap and robots.txt generation
- Performance monitoring with Vercel Analytics
